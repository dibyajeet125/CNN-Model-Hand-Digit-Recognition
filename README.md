# CNN-Model-Hand-Digit-Recognition
Recognising handwritten digits using CNN model


In this project you will discover how to develop a deep learning model to achieve high performance on the handwritten digit recognition task using the MNIST dataset and build a GUI App based on Tkinter where, you can draw the digits (single as well as multiple) and recognize it straight away by draw a bounding box surrounding each digit.

It is easy for the human to perform a task accurately by practicing it repeatedly and memorizing it for the next time. Human brain can process and analyse images easily. Also, recognize the different elements present in the images. The challenge in handwritten digit recognition is mainly caused by the writing style variations of every single individual. So, it is not easy for the machine to recognize the handwritten digits accurately like the humans do. Hence, robust feature extraction is very important to improve the performance of machines. Deep learning is a class of machine learning that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the input. Therefore, deep learning reduces the task of developing new feature extractor for every problem. This characteristic of Deep Learning is a major step ahead of traditional Machine Learning. Most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that we will use in this project.
